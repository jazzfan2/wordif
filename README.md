# Name: worddiff.sh and worddiff.sh
worddiff.sh  - compares two flat text-files word-by-word, and outputs a colored difference-file in html-format.

worddiff2.sh - does same for two directories containing multiple flat text-files, by comparing all shared pairs.

# Description:
worddiff.sh is a wrapper script around 'wdiff()'.
It does a word-by-word comparison between two flat text files.
The result is stored into a color-marked difference-file in .html format.

In this difference-file, the text is ONE combined version of the two input text files, preserving the original text sequence.
Color-marking is used for text fragments not common in both files AT THE INDICATED POSITION, as follows:
- RED text is PRESENT in the 1st file and ABSENT THERE in the 2nd file;
- GREEN text is ABSENT in the 1st file and PRESENT THERE in the 2nd file;
- BLACK text (i.e. without color-marking) is PRESENT THERE in both files.

worddiff2.sh is similar to worddiff.sh, but does MULTIPLE comparing, as follows:
- It acts on two DIRECTORIES, by comparing each pair of equally numbered text-files in both directories;
- It stores all resulting files into a difference-directory;
- As an alternative for .html-output, it can also provide .pdf-output as an option.
