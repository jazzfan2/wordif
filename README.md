# Name: worddiff.sh and worddiff2.sh
worddiff.sh  - compares two flat text-files word-by-word, and outputs a colored difference-file in html-format.

worddiff2.sh - does same for two directories containing multiple flat text-files, by comparing all shared pairs.

# Description:
worddiff.sh is a wrapper script around 'wdiff()' (see https://www.gnu.org/software/wdiff/).
It does a word-by-word comparison between two flat text files.
The result is stored into a color-marked difference-file in .html format.

This difference-file is a united version of the two input text files in the original text sequence.
Text present in both files is printed in black. (Series of) words not appearing in one of the two files
(at the indicated position) are color-marked as follows:
- red text is present in the 1st file, and not present (there) in the 2nd file;
- green text is present in the 2nd file and not present (there) in the 1st file;

worddiff2.sh is similar to worddiff.sh, but does multiple comparison, as follows:
- it acts on two directories, by comparing each pair of equally numbered text-files in both directories;
- It stores all resulting files into a difference-directory;
- As an alternative for .html-output, it can also provide .pdf-output as an option.

In order to be compared by worddiff2.sh, text-file names in either directory must start with the same
unique number, followed by an underscore.
