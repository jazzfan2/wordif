# Name: wordif.sh
wordif.sh  - compares plain-text-files word-by-word, and stores color-marked results in HTML-format.

# Description:
wordif.sh is a wrapper script around 'wdiff()' (see: https://www.gnu.org/software/wdiff/).

It performs word-by-word comparison of one or multiple pair(s) of plain-text-files.
Results are stored as color-marked difference-files in HTML-format, or in PDF-format if option -p is given.

A difference-file is a unification of the two input text-files, preserving original text sequence.
Text present in both files is printed in black. (Groups of) words locally missing in one of the two files
are color-marked as follows:
- red text is present in the 1st file, and not present (there) in the 2nd file;
- green text is present in the 2nd file and not present (there) in the 1st file;

With option -d, wordif.sh acts on two directories instead of two text-files.
It then compares each text-file in the 1st directory to its associated text-file in the 2nd directory.
The resulting difference-files are collected in a difference-directory.

To correctly associate two files in either directory to each other, their respective file names must
start with same unique number, followed by an underscore.
