# Name: worddiff.sh
# Author: Rob Toscani
# Date: 8th December 2025
# Description: This program is a wrapper-script around 'wdiff()'
# (https://www.gnu.org/software/wdiff/), performing word-by-word
# comparison between two flat-text files.
#
# It does either:
# a. one single comparison between given two text-files, or
# b. (optionally) multiple comparison of all pairs of text-files
#     with equally numbered name, shared by given two directories.
#
# The results are stored as color-marked difference-files in HTML-,
# or (optionally) PDF-format.
#
# Usage:  worddiff.sh [-p]   FILE1       FILE2
#         worddiff.sh -d[p]  DIRECTORY1  DIRECTORY2
# Options:
#   -h    Help (this output)
#   -d    Specify two directories as arguments instead of two files;
#         Compare all file-pairs of equally numbered name shared by
#         both directories
#   -p    Output as PDF- instead of HTML-files
#
# Prerequisites:
# - wdiff
# - wkhtmltopdf (if output to pdf is desired)
