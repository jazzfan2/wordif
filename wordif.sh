#!/bin/bash
# Name: wordif.sh
# Author: Rob Toscani
# Date: 7th Januari 2026
# Description: This program performs word-by-word comparison between
# two plain-text-files.
# It is a wrapper-script around 'diff()', and serves as an alternative
# for wdiff() (https://www.gnu.org/software/wdiff/).
#
# It can function in two modes:
# Either:
#     a. (default) one single comparison between given two text-files,
# or:
#     b. (optionally) multiple comparison of all pairs of text-files
#         with equally numbered name, shared by given two directories.
#
# The results are stored as color-marked difference-files in HTML-,
# or (optionally) PDF-format.
#
# Usage:  wordif.sh   [-p]  FILE1       FILE2
#         wordif.sh -d[-p]  DIRECTORY1  DIRECTORY2
# Options:
#   -h    Help (this output)
#   -d    Specify two directories as arguments instead of two files;
#         Compare each file in 1st directory to equally unique-numbered
#         file in 2nd directory
#   -p    Output as PDF- instead of HTML-files
#
# Prerequisite:
# - wkhtmltopdf (if output to PDF is desired)
#
# (The script 'shufflewords.sh' can be used to stress-test this program.)
